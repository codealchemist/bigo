# Big O samples and exercises

## Exercises

Exercises are stored in `sec/exercises`.

Each exercise should provide an original function where we will analyze it's Big O runtime complexity.

We will add an optimized version of the function in the same file and we will export both functions.

We will add unit tests for both functions.


## Samples

Samples are stored in `src/samples`.

They only provide a function or functions where its Big O is analyzed.

They don't have unit tests and we are not meant to enhance them.


## File naming convention

All files inside `src/exercises ` and `src/samples` will be named with numbers and have the `js` extension.

Prefixes:

- Exercises: `e`
- Samples: `s`

### File name samples

Exercises:

- `src/exercises/e-0001.js`
- `src/exercises/e-0002.js`
- `src/exercises/e-0256.js`

Samples:

- `src/samples/s-0001.js`
- `src/samples/s-0002.js`
- `src/samples/s-1024.js`

## Runnings tests

Just run:

`npm test`

Have fun!
